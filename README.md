# Minimal linux image using bazel (with Rust)
This is all very experimental and documentation is basically non-existent. Hopefully that will change one day...

# Building
You need the following dependencies:
* Bazel
* Rust toolchain with cargo and the x86_64-unknown-linux-musl target
* python3 interpreter
* C compiler for x86_64 linux musl 
* the `xz` command must be in your path
